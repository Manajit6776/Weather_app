# Weather App Project Report
**Internship Project at ELEvate Labs**  
**Developer:** Manajit Mondal
**Repository:** [Manajit6776/Weather_app](https://github.com/Manajit6776/Weather_app)  
**Date:** September 2025

## Project Objective
The main goal was to create a real-time weather application. The app should allow users to search for any location and instantly view current weather data, leveraging third-party APIs for accurate and up-to-date information.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Weather Prediction:**  
  The app fetches live weather data for user-specified locations using RapidAPI's weather service.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  - A search bar allows users to input a city name.
  - Results are displayed in a clean, visually appealing panel with detailed statistics.
- **Comprehensive Weather Metrics:**  
  - Temperature (°C/°F)
  - Weather condition (e.g., Mist, Sunny)
  - Region and coordinates
  - Time zone and local time
  - Wind speed, direction, and gusts
  - Atmospheric pressure, humidity, visibility
  - UV index and "feels like" temperature

---

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend:**  
  - Built primarily with HTML, internal JavaScript, and CSS.
  - Responsive, grid-based design with clear separation between input and results.
  - Dynamic content updates based on API responses.

- **Backend/Data Source:**  
  - Utilizes RapidAPI to fetch weather data in real time.
  - JSON responses from the API are parsed and displayed on the web page.

## Screenshots

### Example: Bhubaneswar
- Search results show temperature, mist, local time, wind, humidity, and more.
- Clean, color-coded UI for easy readability.

### Example: Delhi
- Displays location-specific details (e.g., Ontario/Canada for "Delhi" due to API mapping).
- Sunny weather with relevant stats.

## Personal Experience and Learning

- **Solo Development:**  
  Project was completed independently, providing experience across the full stack.
- **Challenges Overcome:**  
  - Faced and debugged frequent issues with API integration and data parsing.
  - Learned to use Flask and JSON APIs, which are valuable for backend development.
- **Skills Acquired:**  
  - API consumption and error handling
  - Frontend design and dynamic DOM updates
  - Data formatting and UX best practices

---

## Repository Overview

- **Languages Used:**  
  - HTML (primary), Python (for possible backend/Flask work), intrnl JavaScript, internsl CSS
- **Public Repository:**  
  - No issues or pull requests open at this time.
  - Not deployed to any cloud service.

## Strengths & Areas for Improvement

**Strengths:**
- Real-time functionality
- Clean and detailed user interface
- Good coverage of relevant weather statistics

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Could add error handling for invalid locations or API errors (worked but not perfectly)
- Mobile responsiveness and accessibility enhancements
- Option to view historical or forecast data
